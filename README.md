Userscript to include CONTRIBUTING rules on issue+pull request+editor pages

# isaacs-github-contact-xposter

This userscript makes it so that, when sending a message
to GitHub support via https://github.com/contact, the
confirmation page after the form is posted features the
message  you just sent, along with a button to cross-post
it as a new issue with the message's subject and body on
https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues for open
discussion with the greater GitHubbing public.
