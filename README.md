# contributing-includer

This userscript appends the content of a repo's guidelines for contributing,
in repos where a notice is displayed when filing a new issue linking to them.
(On pages that include this notice, the link will be changed to point to the
imported file content.)

This implements the enhancement described in [isaacs/github#248][].
